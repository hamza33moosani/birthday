            <h1>Dear Yusra,</h1>
            <p>
                Helllo once again .I am back to make your life miserable again.Ikr this guy literally doesn’t know anything other then writing letters.Like get any better ideas bro.I tried Yusra but I don’t have good ideas.
                ANYWAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY for the 100th time now I guess .Your a big big girl now MashaAllah.Cant believe it man time be zooming .Its insane how far you have came now since last year honestly,like this time last year you were preparing to give your mcat and worrying abt getting into uni and stuff.Look at yourself now in uni and working hard (I don’t care what you think of yourself; you're awesome for me).1st year gonna end soon ;),It’ll be over before you know it that’s why u need to focus on the present instead overthinking everything you have done in the day or what ,its just wasting your big juicy brain energy.I know you have been struggling with a lot of stuff like uni ,me being shit and vague things ;D.But IA man all things will get better and this is just happening for a reason obviously and I pray for you that everything becomes better for you and you have your happy ending.I personally prayed a lot for you when I was gone to hajj(wish I was back there womp womp).
                Honestly though this year has been such a wild ride honestly we started off very strong lol,at the time I confessed fully and things were interesting to say the least xd.We were talking a lot ,I rememeber you were telling me stuff abt the wedding and how late it would go to and all the drama which happened there lol.You almost lost your phone there insane honestly but man was that a rich family bro,booking a whole farmhouse for a shadi event is insane honestly and next thing which Is insane is that YOU CAME BACK HOME AT 5AM LIKE BRO WHAT. EVEN I DON’T GET TO STAY OUT THAT LATE.Khair I am glad nothing bad happened to you on the way back honestly but just very insane.Then we went to Hadiyas house for the first time ,it was fun to have you there honestly .I kept bothering you cuz fortnite on your phone but sadly you didn’t have any space on your phone.I remember you had to go home early though cuz of dawat later ( I really appreciate you coming then),even though you left I kept sending you pics and videos so you no miss the fun).Didnt really do much after that since your uni started.Oh I remembered something you actually did call me when you were in uni ,man I was like why she calling me for a sec but it was nice to have you fulfill the promise I made XD.Khair you made friends in uni without that much problems (in my opinion) and I noticed they were with you walking while you were talking to me on call(cute).You did have some drama in uni with some people but yeah uni do be having wild drama but at the very least now you have a stable group friends who you still talk to which in my opinion is a fun cuz atleast your not alone.

                Anyway I did steal your calc for a while to ,I still remember that day you wore a cool fur sweater  type thing and a black pant ( I am not weird ).You just looked very nice in my opinion .We did the most entertaining thing got sabzi lol .Sabzi is very important honestly for growth and stuff.Fast forward to February and valentine comes around and you get chocolate and I think you went with your girls somewhere as well if I am not mistaken(probably am),our mandi plan never happened though womp womp honestly.After that I don’t think we met much during the semester or atleast I don’t really remember much ,I just remember coming over to give calculator and you were just so tired that day and yet I still took so much of your time and you called my slipper dad chapal ;(.Anyway thennnn the famous os pizza place day ,that was very random honestly lol .I think I was there to collect the zam zam and then we went to out with your sis and the spider man 5 guy (its fine I am not upset over that).Then we went bowling after even though you had exams you sacrificed your time to meet us :D.Specifically me because I was leaving for hajj later and you had exams .Sorry for snatching your phone but also your good at bowling I think you did pretty well honestly.
                Even though I didn’t talk to you ,you still talked to me which is like one of the best and most wholesome things you have ever done ,honestly I love you so much because of that .Its cuz this was like proof this girl 1000000% cares abt me yet when you went to merica all I did was upset you ,I am really sorry for that I should be better honestly .But I do genuinely love you and I pray everytime for you and I don’t know what I would do if this were to end (maybe that’s a threat idk ).

                    But yeah life be wack especially this last month has been wack but hey that’s life honestly everything happens for a reason ,now I need to be even more careful and I really don’t wanna end up doing anything to hurt you and also not put you under any gunnah or anything you know ,but yeah I really do have massive amount of feelings for u .Hopefully things work out and we go to merica and do shooting shoot and go to that fav cake place of yours and you show me your old area and we go to Baharia and tell eachother stuff we don’t rn but only time will tell and Allah has made plans for us and obviously Allahs plans are the best 
                
                    I hope you have a wonderful day today.AND VIOLA AND VIOLIN PRETTY MUCH SAME XD.JK just teasing you ik different
